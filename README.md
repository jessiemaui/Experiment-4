# Welcome to Experiment 4: Data Wrangling and Data Visualization!

## Hello, there! Let me welcome you to the fourth experiment in our Advanced Programming journey!
This time, we're diving deep into the powerful world of Data Wrangling and Data Visualization. If you've ever wondered how raw data trnsforms into meaningful insights, we're now in for a treat!

### In this experiment...
We will be working with the ECE Board Exam Dataset, and we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize it like pros. It's not just about crunching numbers... it's also about telling a story through data! Are we ready now? Let's go!

### I. Intended Learning Outcome
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data.
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization.

### II. Instructions
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 Dataset and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
